\section intro Introduction

Juicer is a Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoder for
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).  It has been developed as a
collaboration between Idiap and the universities of Sheffield and
Edinburgh under the <a href="http://www.amiproject.org/">AMI and
AMIDA</a> projects.

Juicer has been successfully used in the AMI consortium entries in
the recent NIST RT evaluations.  It is used as a real-time
demonstration engine in AMIDA, and increasingly as the main research
engine in other projects.

\section pubs Publications involving Juicer

 - A <a
href="http://publications.idiap.ch/index.php/publications/show/318">user
guide</a>, will be updated soon.
 - <a
href="http://publications.idiap.ch/index.php/publications/show/1389">Silence
modelling in WFSTs</a> at Interspeech 2008.
 - A <a
href="http://publications.idiap.ch/index.php/publications/show/279">paper
about Juicer</a> from MLMI 2006.
 - A presentation by Thomas Hain on the <a
href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.01/tests/rt/2006-spring/pdfs/hain.pdf">RT06
system</a>.
 - Another <a
href="http://publications.idiap.ch/index.php/publications/show/241">paper
about dynamic composition of WFSTs</a>.
 - A <a
href="http://publications.idiap.ch/index.php/publications/show/144">tutorial
about WFSTs</a>.
 .

Note that the static WFST decoder in juicer has been improved
significantly since most of these documents were written.  In
particular, it is as fast as third party LVSR engines.

\section download Obtaining the source code

Juicer is available <a
href="http://www.idiap.ch/software/juicer/sources">here</a>.  It is
released under a BSD license, which is quite permissive.  Further
information is in the README in the distribution.

In order to build juicer, you need these two dependencies:

 - <a href="http://www.torch.ch/">Torch3</a>.  The distribution that
comes with <a href="http://torch3vision.idiap.ch/">Torch3vision</a>
probably works too.
 - <a href="http://www.idiap.ch/software/tracter">Tracter</a>
 .

\section authors Authors

Juicer was originally written by <a
href="http://www.ict.csiro.au/staff/Darren.Moore/">Darren Moore</a>
whilst he was at Idiap, although a significant part of his work was
done under the AMI training program at Sheffield.  Dynamic composition
(on-the-fly) was added by Octavian Cheng (although this is not
currently maintained).  <a href="http://www.idiap.ch/~dines">John
Dines</a> also contributed.

More recently, the package has been overhauled by, and is maintained
by, <a href="http://www.idiap.ch/~pgarner">Phil Garner</a>.  Most of
the HTK compatibility work is by <a
href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~vinny">Vinny Wan</a>.  Le Zhang
recently wrote the "Lite" (and fast) decoder core.
