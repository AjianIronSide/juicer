/** \page build Build instructions

\section build-torch Build Torch3

Torch3 is available from the <a href="http://www.torch.ch">torch
website</a>. The build process is a little odd, and there is no
installation step. The first thing is to copy a makefile:
\verbatim
cd Torch3
cp config/Linux.cfg .
\endverbatim
then add the following options to Linux.cfg:
\verbatim
# Packages you want to use
packages = core speech datasets distributions gradients
\endverbatim
and type
\verbatim
xmake
\endverbatim

\section build-tracter Build and install Tracter

Tracter is available from the <a
href="http://juicer.amiproject.org/tracter">tracter website</a>. Build
instructions are there too, but essentially you just need these
commands:
\verbatim
cd build
export KISSFFT_DIR=/path/to/kiss_fft_v1_2_8
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local ..
make install
\endverbatim
Of course, change the install prefix to wherever you like.

For a more involved build, see the example configure script:
\verbatim
cd build
cp Configure.sh.example Configure.sh
\endverbatim
edit the configure script to reflect your environment.
Then
\verbatim
./Configure.sh
make install
\endverbatim
will install the software locally.

The install will install a pkgconfig file. To allow other programs to
find the pkgconfig, add the path to the environment variable:
\verbatim
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/local/lib/pkgconfig  # sh
setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH $HOME/local/lib/pkgconfig  # csh
\endverbatim

\section build-juicer Build and install Juicer

With tracter and torch3 installed, juicer should install very much
like tracter.  Note that juicer will use pkgconfig to find tracter.
You will need to point to the build at the Torch3 build using the
environment variable:
\verbatim
cd build
export TORCH3_DIR=/path/to/Torch3
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/local/lib/pkgconfig
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local ..
make install
\endverbatim
You may find that it is easier to compile tracter with Torch3,
especially if using shared libraries.
