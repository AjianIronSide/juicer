If you got juicer as a tarball then it includes a standard gnu build
environment.  Just follow the instructions in INSTALL, although you
might wish to use a VPATH build described below.

If you got juicer from git, you need autoconf and automake.  The
following commands are necessary to boot up the gnu build environment:

 autoheader
 aclocal
 libtoolize
 autoconf
 automake -a

Then, assuming you want to use this as a working repository, I suggest
you use a VPATH style build.  This builds in a separate tree allowing
several parallel builds that don't mess up the source directory:

 mkdir build
 cd build
 ../configure CXXFLAGS='-Wall -Os -g' --with-torch3=/path/to/Torch3
 make

The executables will appear in build/src

To use the raw HTK model mechanism, add these options, with text to
suit your site, to configure:

  --with-htk-includes="-I/path/to/HTK/HTK_V3.4/include"
  --with-htk-libs="-L/path/to/HTK/HTK_V3.4/lib -lhtk"


Documentation is provided in doxygen form.  From the build directory,
type

 doxygen

You can then point a browser at html/index.html
