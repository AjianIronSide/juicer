Building the Juicer LVCSR Decoder
=================================

http://juicer.amiproject.org/juicer/

Build with CMake
----------------

As of March 2010, the build system is based on CMake.  To build, you
should only need to do the following:

 cd build
 cp Configure.sh.example Configure.sh
 (edit Configure.sh to suit your environment)
 ./Configure.sh
 make
 make install

Below are instructions for the old Gnu build system.  This should be
removed in a future version.  Currently the Gnu system is the only way
to build using IPP.  There is no fundamental limitation; simply I
don't have access to IPP right now to test it.

Creating configure 
------------------
(skip this if you got juicer as a tarball)
If you got juicer from git, you need autoconf and automake.  The
following commands are necessary to boot up the gnu build environment:

     autoheader
     aclocal
     libtoolize
     autoconf
     automake -a

Required Libs
-------------
The following libs need to be built and installed prior to building juicer:
1. Tracter
    http://juicer.amiproject.org/tracter/
2. Torch3
    http://www.torch.ch/
   If Torch3 is not detected automatically, you can use --with-torch3 option:
   eg: configure --with-torch3=/path/to/Torch3/

Optional Libs
-------------
1. Intel Integrated Performance Primitives lib (Intel IPP Lib)
    Juicer can use the Intel IPP Lib for faster GMM calculation. After
    installing Intel IPP Lib, use the following configure option to activate
    IPP support:
    configure --with-ipproot=DIR
    where DIR is the root directory of the installed IPP lib, usually defined
    in environment varialbe $IPPROOT
    eg: configure --with-ipproot=$IPPROOT

2. HTK
   Juicer can be linked against HTK to use HTK's GMM calculation routines.
   It will offer compatibility for programs developed with HTK.
   configure --with-htk-includes=DIR --with-htk-libs=DIR
   eg.  configure --with-htk-includes=-I/path/to/HTKLib/ \
                  --with-htk-libs="-L/path/to/HTKLib/ /path/to/HTKLib/HTKLib.a"

3. A SWIG wrapper for java can be build using:
   configure --enable-swig=yes


Building Juicer
---------------
If you got juicer as a tarball then it includes a standard gnu build
environment.  Just follow the instructions in INSTALL, although you
might wish to use a VPATH build described below.

Then, assuming you want to use this as a working repository, I suggest
you use a VPATH style build.  This builds in a separate tree allowing
several parallel builds that don't mess up the source directory:

 mkdir build
 cd build
 ../configure CXXFLAGS='-Wall -Os -g' --with-torch3=/path/to/Torch3
 make

The executables will appear in build/src





Documentation is provided in doxygen form.  From the build directory,
type

 doxygen

You can then point a browser at html/index.html
