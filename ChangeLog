0.8.0
	Feature mechanism changed to use tracter.
	SWIG interface to Java
0.6.1
	This release is just cosmetic changes to the build environment:
	o Move src/index.h to doc/index.doc
	o Doxygen installs to top level, not in doc/
	o README, INSTALL etc are there
	o config.h.in is gone - build it with autoheader
	o Header files added to the distrubution

0.6.0
	gramgen now puts auxiliary symbols (#phi) into backoff loops
	lexgen puts the #phi onto a loop at the initial state (with
	-addPhiLoop) cdgen passes through #phi symbols.

	Juicer can now take both language model match factor and insertion
	penalty at the decoder level (-lmScaleFactor and -insPenalty).

	The short pause transition is now handled in the decoder meaning
	that the FST does not need to handle it (i.e. do not use
	-pauseTeeTransProb).

	lexgen can now normalise pronunciations such that the FST is
	stochastic (with -normalise).

	Build scripts are now sensitive to auxiliary symbols.  Not using
	these symbols will produce an FST that is non-determinisable, and
	the tools may run out of memory before realising that it is
	non-determinisable.

	gramgen now has a -normalise option to make the resulting (ngram)
	FST stochastic.  It is not implemented efficiently, and doesn't
	seem to have a noticeable effect.
